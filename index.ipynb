    "\n",
    "The key takeaways from this section include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deep neural network representations can lighten the burden and automate certain tasks of heavy data preprocessing\n",
    "* Deep representations need exponentially fewer hidden units than shallow networks, to obtain the same performance\n",
    "* Parameter initialization, forward propagation, cost function evaluation, and backward propagation are again the cornerstones of deep networks\n",
    "* Tensors are the building blocks of neural networks and a good understanding of them and how to use them in Python is crucial\n",
    "* Scalars can be seen as 0-D tensors. Vectors can be seen as 1-D tensors, and matrices as 2-D tensors\n",
    "* The usage of tensors reaches beyond matrices: tensors can have N dimensions\n",
    "* Tensors can be created and manipulated using Numpy\n",
    "* Keras makes building neural networks in Python easy, and you learned how to do that in this section\n",
    "* You can use Keras to do some NLP as well, e.g. for tokenization "
